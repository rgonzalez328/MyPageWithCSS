<h1>MADONNA</h1>
<h3>My Favorite Singer</h3>
<p> Madonna is far and away my favorite singer. I've been listening to her since I was a toddler. I've been a fan since I was old enough to understand who she was. I think the reason I love listening to Madonna so much as an adult is because my mother would play her when I was a child. Listening to her is like a comfort thing to me.</p>
